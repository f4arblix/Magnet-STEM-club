    <p>Building teamwork, creativity, and time management through hands-on projects</p>

    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>Many students struggle with time management. Procrastination, missed deadlines, and late nights finishing work create stress and lower grades. This problem affects motivation, mental health, and school performance.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>The Solution: Magnet STEM Club</h2>
    <p>The Magnet STEM Club is a space where students work together on fun, hands-on STEM challenges while learning better time management skills naturally. Instead of forcing schedules, students learn planning and teamwork by doing engaging projects.</p>
    <h3>How It Works</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Each meeting includes a short planning session and a quick STEM challenge.</li>
      <li>Students share their goals and struggles managing time.</li>
      <li>Team projects teach how to divide tasks and meet deadlines.</li>
      <li>Members build habits that reduce stress and improve confidence.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

    <h2>Persuasive Approach</h2>
    <p><strong>Logos:</strong> Research shows that students who practice structured time management have higher grades and lower stress levels.</p>
    <p><strong>Pathos:</strong> Many students feel alone and overwhelmed. This club offers a community that supports and motivates each other.</p>
    <p><strong>Ethos:</strong> Educators and psychologists agree that teamwork and accountability help students stay on track and develop responsibility.</p>
